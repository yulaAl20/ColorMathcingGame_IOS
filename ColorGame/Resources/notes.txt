new feature:
- Color threshold for hard level

Lecturer suggestions:
1. Accessibility for color blind people (different types of color bliindnesses) - with a accessibility function choosing in the startup page
use shapes instead colors maybe
2. Game build up level-wise, different level generation path for easy,medium, hard levels.

TILE GRAPHICS:
Particle sparks
Haptic feedback on match
Screen shake on big combos
Combo multiplier UI (x2, x3, etc.)



How Scoring Works:

Level bonus    = × level
Final gain     = N × 10 × level
